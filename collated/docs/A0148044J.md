#### <a id="find"></a>4. Finding specific tasks: `find`
Want to search for important things that you need to do? Or know when is your next coming exam? If you need to find certain tasks by keywords, you can use the `find` command.

1. Normal search
Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]...`

> * Normal search will display a task that matches at least one keyword (i.e. `OR` search).
> * You can use `INDICATOR/KEYWORD` to specify the keyword belong to a specific attributes, available INDICATOR: n=, s=, st=, e=, et=, i=
> * You can use `'` to replace the whitespace if one search keyword contains whitespace, or inbx_0 treat it as multiple keywords
 eg: `do'CS2103'homework` will match `do CS2103 homework' 
> * Tasks matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
> * Keywords are non case-sensitive, ie, `homework` will match `HOMEWORK`
> * The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Movie Night` will match `Night Movie`
> * Only full words will be matched e.g. `visit` will not match `visiting`

Example: 
`find meeting CS2103quiz`

Return `MEETING` or `CS2103Quiz` but not `meeting with CS2103 tutor` or `quiz` 

2. Logic operation search

> Format:  `[LOGIC_OPERATOR] KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS] [MORE_LOGIC_OPERATOR]...`

> * Logic operation search will display a task only when it fits the logic expression
> * LOGIC_OPERATOR: `|` means OR, `&` means AND, `(` and `)` used to group the logic operations
> * You can use `INDICATOR/KEYWORD` to specify the keyword belong to a specific attributes, available INDICATOR: n=, s=, st=, e=, et=, i=
> * You can use any valid logic operation format
> * valid logic operation format: 
>  1. Brackets must be closed properly
>  2.  Keywords must not contains whitespace and any keywords cannot followed by another keyword without `LOGIC_OPERATOR` in between
>  3.  `|` `&` `(` cannot followed by '|' '&' )' without `keywords` in between

Examples:

`find homework | assignment`: 
Return  `homework` or `assignment`

`find homework & e=tmr`:
Return `homework` that ends `tomorrow`

`find (homework | assignment) & s=tmr & i=r`:
Return `homework` or `meeting` that start on `tomorrow` with high importance `Red`

> * acceptable input for 
> * `NAME`: n, Name, `Start Time`: s, start, `End Time`: e, end, `Importance`: i, importance
> *  `ASCENDING`: ASC, ascending, ascend, `DECENDING`: DESC, descending, descend
> * All sort keywords are non-case sensitive, ie, `Importance` is `importance` 
> * Default sorting order is `ASCENDING` for Name, Start Time and End Time but `DESCENDING` for Importance
