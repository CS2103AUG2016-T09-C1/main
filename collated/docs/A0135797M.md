##**About**
Inbx_0 (pronounced as Inbox Zero) is a personal task managing assistant that helps to keep your tasks in order. It will help you manage your email inbox easily so as to keep your inbox uncluttered. 

Unlike all the other task managers out there, Inbx_0 is a simple program that runs on single-line commands. Inbx_0 will execute your commands based on what you type immediately. No more looking for buttons and menus to get the program to do what you want. So let's get started!

## **Quick Start**

0. Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.<br>
   > Having any Java 8 version is not enough. <br>
   This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
   
1. Download the latest `inbx_0.jar` from the [releases](../../../releases) tab.
2. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for Inbx_0
3. Double-click the Inbx_0 icon
4. Double-click the Task Manager.jar file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

5. Type a command in the command box and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to execute it. <br>
   e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> will open the help window. 
6. Some example commands you can try:
   * **`add EE2020 Midterms`** :  adds a task called `EE2020 Midterms` to the Task Manager
   * **`list`** : lists all tasks
   * **`delete`**`1` : deletes the 1st task shown in the current list
   * **`undo`**`1` : undoes the last command
   * **`exit`** : exits the app
7. Refer to the [Features](#features) section below for details of each command.<br>

## **Color Schemes**

We understand that everyone is unique, and so when using our app, you can express your uniqueness with our fun different color schemes!
Upon opening the app, you can either use the keyboard shortcut <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>1</kbd> to <kbd>8</kbd> to cycle between various themes, or use your mouse to click on individual themes, via the `Preferences` menu.

Currently we offer 8 colors:

**1. Antique White**

## **Features**

Inbx_0 can perform multiple different functions based on various commands that you type into the command line. There is a certain command format for each command and the general format can be described as such: 

**Command Format** <br>
1.  Words in `UPPER_CASE` are  parameters that are compulsory and will be taken in by the app (e.g. NAME, DATE). 
<br>
2. Items in `SQUARE_BRACKETS` are optional and will not be required in order to perform the command (e.g. [tags], [date]).
<br>
3. Items with `...` after them can have multiple instances. This means that there can be more than one occurrence of the particular item. For example, â€œ[t/TAG]...â€? means that you can have multiple tags. 
<br>
4.  The order of parameters is fixed and needs to be strictly followed.

Parameter | Description
---------|:---------
[TASK] | Name of the task 
[s=START_DATE] | The date that the task will start on 
[st=START_TIME] | The time of the start of the task 
[e=END_DATE] | The date of the task that the task will end on 
[et=END_TIME] | The time of the end of the task 
[i=IMPORTANCE] | The priority of the task. It can be `green`, `yellow` or `red`, from low to high importance 
[t=TAGS] | Tags that are assigned to the task 

>  For Dates and Times, the program utiilises natural language processing. This means that you can enter commands in multiple formats such as "tmr, next week, next wed, 3 days later, noon, 8am, 1400" and Inbx_0 will read them just fine! <br>

The `IMPORTANCE` parameter takes in variations of the colours `red`, `green` or `yellow`, such as `Red, Green, Yellow`, `r, g, y`, or `R, G, Y`.

The rest of the guide will be using the general command format to describe what is needed to execute each command.
<br><br>

#### <a id="help"></a>1. Getting help: `help`
Format: `help`

If you ever get confused while using our app, you can type in "help" in the command box and hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>
It will instantly open up a help window, showing you the complete list of commands that you can enter, instantly putting you back on the right path!

#### <a id="setdir"></a>16. Saving your tasklist to a specific directory: `saveas`
Format: `saveas FILE_DIRECTORY`

You can specify a directory for saving your tasklist by typing the following: `saveas FILE_DIRECTORY` <br>

The filepath will be verified and you will be able to save your tasklist in a new directory.

Example: 
* `saveas  C:\Users\Jim\Desktop\taklist.xml` <br>
Saves the tasklist on the desktop of Jim's computer.

>To reset the save directory for Inbx_0, simple type: `saveas reset`. This will reset the save file to /data/tasklist.xml
